1. ***The Pandas and NumPy libraries are crucial for making financial calculations.***

2. ***Financial data may be accessed from external sources.***

3. ***The term structure of interest rates is a key financial metric.***

The first two hints and results repeat some basic concepts of *NumPy* and *Pandas*.  The third one focuses on accessing data from the *U.S. Treasury*. The final one asks you to calculate and graph the term structure of interest rates.
