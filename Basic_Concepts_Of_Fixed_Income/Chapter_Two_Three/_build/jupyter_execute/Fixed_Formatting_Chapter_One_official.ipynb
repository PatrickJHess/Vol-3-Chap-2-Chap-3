As such, we can replicate a coupon bond with a sequence of zero-coupon bonds: The number of zero-coupon bonds with a maturity of $t$ equals the coupon bond’s cash flow at $t$ divided by the zero-coupon bond’s principal. For example, consider a \\\\$40 coupon that is paid every six months before maturity. This coupon is valued with a sequence of 0.04 zero-coupon bonds, with a \\\\$1,000 principal and maturities matching the coupon payment dates. The coupon bond’s payment at maturity equals 1.040 zero-coupon bonds, with a \\\\$1,000 principal and the same maturity as the coupon bond. Further, a coupon bond’s value is the sum of all the zero-coupon bond values needed to replicate that bond’s cash flows.

    "    line-height: 1.5;\"><big>Thus far, bond values have been represented as the sum of the zero-coupon bonds’ values. But we must consider the zero-coupon bonds’ *market prices*&mdash;not their “theoretical” values. Will the value relation between zero-coupon and coupon bonds hold if we use the market prices of zero-coupon bonds? To answer that question, let’s look at examples where the coupon bond is worth more or less than the sum of the zero-coupon bonds. First, consider a case where the coupon bond’s price exceeds the sum of the zero-coupon bond prices:</big>\n",

    "    text-indent: 0.25in;\n",
    "    line-height: 1.5;\"><big>If the price of the coupon bond exceeds the sum of the zero-coupon bond prices, the coupon bond can be *shorted*.<sup>1</sup> The zero-coupon bonds can then be purchased with the proceeds, leaving the investor with identical cash flows for a lower price. Consider if the inequality is reversed:</big>\n",

    "    text-indent: 0.25in;\n",
    "    line-height: 1.5;\"><big>In this case, the *zero-coupon bonds* can be shorted, and the proceeds can be used to buy the coupon bond. This ability to recreate cash flows allows for arbitrage between zero-coupon and coupon bonds; as a result, the coupon bond prices equal the costs of the zero-coupon bonds used to recreate their cash flows. It is the law of one price in action. Whatever the bond prices might have been in theory does not matter. Those prices were ideas&mdash;the market value is a fact. This arbitrage relationship is important for deriving the *term of structure of interest rates* and *forward rates*, which we’ll examine later in this chapter. These concepts are key to understanding bond pricing as well as some important fixed-income derivatives.</big>\n",

The <font color='green'>diff()</font> method subtracts the lower indexed value from the higher&mdash;in this example, the maturity of four weeks from eight weeks and eight weeks from thirteen and so on. The calculation of forward rates is the reverse (or the negative) value of the <font color='green'>diff()</font> method. This negative value is assigned to the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array. The <font color='green'>diff()</font> function returns four values (there is no forward rate for the first month).

The NumPy method <font color='green'>insert()</font> is used to add a column with <font color='green'>nan</font> as the first column of the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array. As you might have guessed, <font color='green'>nan</font> stands for “not a number,” and it’s ignored in calculations.

    "<big>In this chapter, we used Pandas and NumPy to explore different ways of calculating the term structure of interest rates for September 15, 2022, and September 30, 2025. These term structures reveal an economy in transition. On September 15, 2022, rates were increasing with maturity and could be expected to continue rising. By September 30, 2025, however, the pattern had shifted. Although the overall level of rates was higher on September 30, 2025, the term structure showed a slight downward slope. These differences indicate two different economic states: one in which inflation was expected to increase (September 2022) and one in which it wasn’t (September 2025). Calibrating the term structure of interest rates this way has highlighted Python’s rich ecosystem of libraries and methods, and more importantly, shown us the language’s utility for finance.</big>\n",
