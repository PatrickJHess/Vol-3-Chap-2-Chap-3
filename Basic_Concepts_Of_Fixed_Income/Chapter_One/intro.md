## Volume: Basic Concepts of Fixed Income

### Chapter One: Basic Bond Concepts and the Term Structure of Interest Rates
  

Bond pricing is founded on two core principles:

1. **The Arbitrage Principle:** This principle asserts that the value of bonds making multiple payments (like coupons) is equal to the value of a portfolio of single-payment bonds, known as zero-coupon bonds. This portfolio is structured to replicate the payment schedule of the multi-payment bond.  
2. **The Present Value Principle:** This principle states that the price of a single-payment bond is determined by its present value factor.

These principles form the basis for pricing all financial instruments. Understanding the present value factors embedded in these prices is crucial, as their description offers significant insight into the state of financial markets.

This chapter initiates our study of bond pricing and the term structure of interest rates-the description of the underlying present value factors. Two fundamental concepts will be introduced: spot rates of interest and forward rates of interest. These are central to the valuation of financial instruments and derivatives.

To illustrate these concepts, we will calculate spot and forward rates using U.S. Treasury Bills data from two distinct dates. The data will be sourced from a dedicated data library for this volume and external URLs. The results will be presented graphically to highlight two contrasting market conditions: one where inflation is expected to rise and another where it is expected to moderate.

Subsequent chapters will build upon these bond pricing principles and the term structure to provide a deeper analysis of financial instrument pricing and the term structure itself.
