The calculation of forward rates is the reverse (or the negative) value of the <font color='green'>diff()</font> method. This negative value is assigned to the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array. The <font color='green'>diff()</font> function returns four values (there is no forward rate for the first month). To align the spot and forward rates on the graph, a dummy value, <font color='green'>nan</font>, is inserted in the forward-rate array. The NumPy method <font color='green'>insert()</font> is used to add a column with <font color='green'>nan</font> as the first column of the <font color='green'>forward_rates</font> array. As you might have guessed, <font color='green'>nan</font> stands for “not a number,” and it’s ignored in calculations. The arguments of <font color='green'>insert()</font> are the array, position, value, and axis. The rows are <font color='green'>axis 0</font>, and the columns are <font color='green'>axis 1</font>.
