# Functions Imported by the Chapter.

Chapter One's notebooks import two helper functions:

1. [save_results](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Imported-Functions/save_results.html#save-results-is-a-helper-function-that-asks-users-if-they-wish-to-save-files-created-by-financial-python): This function helps track files generated by notebooks that are saved. 
2. [one_y_axis](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Imported-Functions/one_y_axis.html#one-y-axis-is-a-helper-function-for-plotting-graphs-created-by-financial-python): This function utilizes the matplotlib library to graph multiple series on a single y-axis.

Both functions are part of a module downloaded from DropBox. These and other functions within the [module](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Imported-Functions/intro.html#functions-imported-by-the-volume-basic-concepts-of-fixed-income) are intended to shift focus from coding to financial concepts.
