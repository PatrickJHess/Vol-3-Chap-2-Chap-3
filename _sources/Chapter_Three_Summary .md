# Summarizing Chapter Three

This chapter developed functions that calculate both paynent dates and amounts of bonds.  Both required to calculate the present value of a bond that is key for expanding our exploratin of the term structure of interest rates.The manipulation of dates relied by the **datetime** and **holidays** libraries. A future chapter uses the function of this and Chapter Two in calculating the term sturcuture of interest rates with 304 bonds.

**Key Takeaways**

* Calculate all the schedulued payment dates of a bond.  
* Convert the scheduled payment dates to actual payment dates.  
* Create a NumPy array of payment dates and amounts that can be used to calculate the presnet value of a bond.  

## **We are now ready to laucnh our bootstrapping of the term structure of interest rates
