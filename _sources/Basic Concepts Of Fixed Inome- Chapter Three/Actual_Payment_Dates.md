# Actual Versus Scheduled Payment Dates

A bond's accrued interest is calculated based on scheduled payment amounts and dates, but its present value relies on the actual amounts and dates. Although the payment amounts are fixed, the actual payment dates often deviate from the scheduled ones.

Actual payment dates correspond to settlement dates, while scheduled payments are determined relative to the bond's maturity date. Since settlement days exclude weekends, holidays, and Good Friday, any payments scheduled for these days are advanced to the next available settlement day.

The notebook *Non Settlement Days* introduces the <font='green'>adust\_bond\_pay\_dates()</font> function. This function takes a date object and returns a settlement date, utilizing the **holidays** library, the `easter` function from the **datetutil** module, and the <font color='green'>validate_date()</font> function developed in the *Calculating Accrued Interest* notebook.

The *Bond Pay Data* notebook then uses <font='green'>adust\_bond\_pay\_dates()</font> to convert scheduled payment dates to actual payment dates. Scheduled payment dates are first generated by counting backward from the maturity date and are stored in a Pandas Series. The Pandas <font color='green'>apply()</font> method is then used with <font='green'>adust\_bond\_pay\_dates()</font>  to convert these scheduled dates into the actual payment dates.

A two-dimensional NumPy array is created from the actual dates and the payment amounts.
