        "The <font color='green'>bond_pay_data()</font> function relies upon the helper function <font color='green'>last_day_monthh()</font> introduced in Chapter Two: Accrued Interest.  The function is included in the module <font color='green'>basic_conceepts_fixed_income</font>.  Although it is available to <font color='green'>bond_pay_data()</font> imported from the module, it is not available to the function in the previous cell of the notebook.  If you executed this cell, <font color='green'>last_day_monht()</font> can not be accessed by <font color='green'>bond_pay_data()</font>.  In this instance you need to import it from <font color='green'>basic_conceepts_fixed_income</font> before you use <font color='green'>bond_pay_data()</font>.\n",
