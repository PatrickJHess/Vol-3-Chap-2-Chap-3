This chapter uses the Python libraries Pandas and NumPy. The basic usage of these libraries is detailed in three Notebooks: "[A Quick Introduction to Pandas](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/An_Introduction_To_Pandas.html)" reviews some basic concepts of Pandas, "[A Quick Introduction to NumPy](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/An_Introduction_To_NumPy.html)" and "[A Quick Introduction to Manipulating Dates](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/An_Introduction_To_NumPy.html)"  do the same for NumPy and the datetime module. These Notebooks are part of the introductory volume [Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Introduction-To-Python-For-Financial-Python/intro.html). Portions of the volume will be cited throughout this chapter. Feel free to consult these materials as needed for greater discussion of Python concepts.
