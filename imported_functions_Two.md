# Function Imported by Chapter Two.

Chapter Two's notebooks import the helper function:

[create_workbook](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Imported-Functions/create_workbook.html#create-workbook-is-a-helper-function-that-creates-excel-workbooks-from-dataframes-created-by-financial-python). This function creates an Excel workbook from a Pandas DataFrame. 


The function is part of a module downloaded from DropBox. These and other functions within the [module](https://patrickjhess.github.io/Imported-Functions/intro.html#functions-imported-by-the-volume-basic-concepts-of-fixed-income) are intended to shift focus from coding to financial concepts.
